### The tentative project title: Serious facts about life

### The motivation for this project

Suicide is a major public health concern globally. According to WHO,
about 800,000 people die by suicide in 2016, of which 79% occurred in
low- and middle-income countries. Overall, suicide accounts for 1.4% of
all deaths worldwide, and has become the second leading cause of death
among 15-29 age group. Our group aims to summarize the general trend in
global suicide rate over time, and explore possible influential factors
related to suicide, including age, gender, country and socioeconomic
status. Every suicide is tragic but also preventable. Therefore, we hope
to arouse public awareness of suicide prevention and provide
illustrative background information for further research and development
of preventive strategies.

### The intended final products

In the end, we will finish a report, in which we will discuss the trend
of suicide over the recent 30 years worldwide and the association
between potential variables. Besides, we will create a webpage and a
narrated screencast for our project.

### The anticipated data sources

We plan to utilize a compiled dataset pulled from four other datasets by
locations and time. In the dataset, we have HDI (Human development
index) from the United Nations Development Program (2018), GDP per year
from World Bank (2018), and suicide information from Suicide in the
Twenty-First Century \[dataset\] and World Health Organization Suicide
prevention (2018). We will analyze the dataset to find signals and draw
conclusions.

### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

The expected analysis include three parts. First, a general description
of data would be applied, including mean, range, variance, and other
statistical measurements of the rates. Distribution of suicide rates
among countries, genders, years would be shown, thus the “dangerous”
group with higher suicide rates can be identified. According to the
year-rate results, the trend of suicide rate could also be detected
globally and domestically. Second, doing proportion tests is necessary
when we want to know if there are significant differences between
groups. Third, linear regression methods can be used to explore the
potential relationship between suicide rates and other variables.

We use histogram or boxplot to show the rate distribution. Bar plots are
to compare rates in groups. Line charts would be utilized to show the
general trends and linear relationship. Tables are to show the
statistical values in each proportion test.

How to find the most proper ways to visualize data would be the biggest
challenge.
