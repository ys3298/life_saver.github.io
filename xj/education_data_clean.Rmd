The raw dataset comes from the the survey American Community Survey(ACS) contain educational attainment information of aech state in 2000, 2012 and 2017. We only focus on data from 2017. We select 4 key variables, including share of population with `advanced degree`, `bachelor's degree`, `associate's or some college`, and `high school or less`. To clarify the year of information, we add a `year` column.
